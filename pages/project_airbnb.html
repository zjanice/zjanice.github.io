        <p class="title is-2">About The Visualization</p>
        <p>In this visualization, each circle represents a host based in Boston.
           The size of the circle represents the estimated monthly income from
           renting place(s) out. The larger the circle, the higher the income
           will be.</p>
        <p class="highlight indent">Expected income/ month = Price/ night * Reviews/ month * Minimum nights + Cleaning fee * Reviews/ month</p>
        <p>Both X axis and Y axis contain 5 options, including Minimum nights,
          Reviews Per Month, Cleaning Fee, Price, Calculated Host Listings.
          Users are able to explore the relationship among these 20 combinations.
          Inspired by Inside Airbnb, an Airbnb guest may leave a review after stay.
          The minimum night, price and number of reviews per month can be used
          to estimate the monthly income for each listing. Some hosts may have
          more than one listing, and this is how ‘Calculated Host Listings’ comes.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The filter section on the right hand side contains 5 dimensions,
          including Room Type, Cancellation Policy, Amenities, Family Pets,
          and Neighbourhood. Each dimension includes a few filters. Each filter
          can be seen as a VARIABLE.You can select or deselect any variable(s)
          to compare and contrast the trend. All the filters have been selected
          as default with background in grey + text in white . If deselecting
          any filter, it will turn into background in white + text in grey.
          Multiple filters can be applied across dimensions. Only one of the
          five dimensions can be used as color palette. For example, select
          minimum nights from X axis and price from Y axis, and use Room Type
          as color palette. You will see at least </br>
            <span class="indent"> 1) the overall price of entire home will be
              higher than that of Private Room.</span></br>
            <span class="indent"> 2) an Airbnb host have higher chances to make
              more money when setting up 1-4 nights as minimum nights
              (through the clustered rectangles). </span>
