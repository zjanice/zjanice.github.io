    I am a Ph.D. student studying <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing" class="text-secondary">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" class="text-secondary">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, under the advisory of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~andrea/" class="text-secondary">Dr. Andrea Grimes Parker</a>. <!-- 
    Prior to transferring to Georgia Tech, I was a Ph.D. student in Personal Health Informatics at Northeastern University</a>.     -->

    My research interest lies at the intersection of <b>crisis informatics</b>, <b>visualization</b>, and <b>health sciences</b>. My research broadly contributes to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Information Visualization (VIS), and Health Informatics.  
</p>

<p>
    My PhD dissertation examines how people interact with and perceive the massive amounts of evolving and emergent information and technologies during crises, with a focus on marginalized communities. I further examine how trust forms, shifts, and collapses as crisis information infrastructures evolve. 
    To explore how technological systems can be designed to reduce inequity, I capture people’s interactions with technologies and the dynamics of people’s perceptions during emerging crises through surveys, interviews, observations, co-design, systematic analysis of artifacts, and user evaluations. My research sheds light on how technologies can mitigate informational vulnerability and help marginalized groups navigate through crises.

<!-- My research interest lies at the intersection of crisis informatics, visualization, and health sciences. My research seeks to enhance the autonomy of marginalized populations during crises through information technology. My PhD dissertation has focused on examining how the design of information and technologies shapes trust and distrust among marginalized communities, and how mistrust undermines their autonomy during crises. To explore how technological systems can be designed to reduce inequity, I capture people’s interactions with technologies and the dynamics of people’s perceptions during emerging crises through surveys, interviews, observations, co-design, systematic analysis of artifacts, and user evaluations. My research shapes the understanding of how marginalized groups interact and perceive the massive amount of information and how trust forms, develops and collapses among these groups. My research sheds light on how technologies can mitigate informational vulnerability and help marginalized groups navigate through crises. -->

                This thread of work focuses on crisis visualizations (i.e., visual representations of information about COVID-19). We examined who, (uses) what data, (to communicate) what messages, in what form, under what circumstances in the context of COVID-19 crisis visualizations, to whom, and with what effect.
