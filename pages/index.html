<h3 class="mt-4">About</h3>
<p>
    I am a Ph.D. student studying <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd/human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, under the advisory of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~andrea/">Dr. Andrea Grimes Parker</a>. 
    Prior to transferring to Georgia Tech, I was a Ph.D. student in Personal Health Informatics at Northeastern University</a>.    
</p>

<p>
    My research interest lies at the intersection of <b>crisis informatics</b>, <b>visualization</b>, and <b>health sciences</b>.  
    My research seeks to empower traditionally marginalized and vulnerable populations through information, visualization, and technology. My PhD dissertation work examines how public trust and perceptions are shaped by, and in turn, shape the design of information and technologies during crises, with a focus on marginalized communities. 
    To explore how technological systems can be designed to reduce inequity, I captures people's perceptions of and interactions with technologies through interviews, observations, participatory design, longitudinal surveys, and systematic analysis of artifacts. I design and evaluate technologies that help people address their values, including basic needs and esteem needs. 
    My research commitment lies in my belief that "we cannot design usable and useful information and technologies for them without them."

<p>
    My research broadly contributes to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Information Visualization (VIS), and Health Informatics.
