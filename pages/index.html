<h3 class="mt-4">About</h3>
<p>
    I am a Ph.D. student studying <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd/human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, under the advisory of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~andrea/">Dr. Andrea Grimes Parker</a>. 
    Prior to transferring to Georgia Tech, I was a Ph.D. student in Personal Health Informatics at Northeastern University</a>.    
</p>

<p>
    My research interest lies at the intersection of <b>visualization</b>, <b>health</b>, and <b>crisis informatics</b>. 
    I am broadly interested in studying how people perceive and use information and communication technologies (ICTs), with a focus on examining equity issues in technology design and usage, and vulnerable populations.  
    I see vulnerability a relational and relative concept that can increase due to physical and psychological constraints (e.g., older adults suffering from mobility, sensory, and cognitive limitations) and socio-economic disruptions (e.g., crisis situations), rather than a static characteristic of an individual or a particular group.
    
    To guide my empirical and design work, I capture human experiences, perceptions, and views through a variety of methods, such as interviews, observations, participatory design, surveys, and systematic analysis of artifacts. Below, I discuss how I have contributed to disciplinary knowledge and critical conversations about how vulnerable populations perceive and use technologies, and how technologies can be designed to help them address their needs.  </br>
    My research contributes to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), 
    Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Information Visualization (VIS), 
    and Health Informatics.
