    I am a Ph.D. candidate studying <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing" class="text-secondary">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" class="text-secondary">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, under the advisory of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~andrea/" class="text-secondary">Dr. Andrea Grimes Parker</a>.

    My research interest lies at the intersection of <b>crisis informatics</b>, <b>visualization</b>, and <b>health sciences</b>. My research broadly contributes to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Information Visualization (VIS), and Health Informatics.

    My PhD dissertation examines how the crisis information infrastructures (i.e., networks of sociotechnical systems that facilitate information and communication during crises) shape, and simultaneously, are shaped by people's interactions with, perceptions of, and trust towards information, technologies, and information infrastructures. I further examine how trust forms, shifts, and collapses as crisis information infrastructures evolve. I capture people’s interactions with technologies and the dynamics of people’s perceptions and trust during emerging crises through a variety of empirical methods, such as (longitudinal) surveys, interviews, observations, co-design, systematic analysis of artifacts, and user evaluations.

    In my spare time, I am a photographer <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>. I also have a sweet puppy---a Border Collie Dog breed (and his name is "Sunny") <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>. Some of my hobbies teach me how to see the world and research from other lens through my camera and my puppy's perspective, with love and peace.

<!-- My research interest lies at the intersection of crisis informatics, visualization, and health sciences. My research seeks to enhance the autonomy of marginalized populations during crises through information technology. My PhD dissertation has focused on examining how the design of information and technologies shapes trust and distrust among marginalized communities, and how mistrust undermines their autonomy during crises. To explore how technological systems can be designed to reduce inequity, I capture people’s interactions with technologies and the dynamics of people’s perceptions during emerging crises through surveys, interviews, observations, co-design, systematic analysis of artifacts, and user evaluations. My research shapes the understanding of how marginalized groups interact and perceive the massive amount of information and how trust forms, develops and collapses among these groups. My research sheds light on how technologies can mitigate informational vulnerability and help marginalized groups navigate through crises. -->

                This thread of work focuses on crisis visualizations (i.e., visual representations of information about COVID-19)---an emerging but integral and critical component of information infrastructure. We examined who, (uses) what data, (to communicate) what messages, in what form, under what circumstances in the context of COVID-19 crisis visualizations, to whom, and with what effect.
