    I am a Ph.D. candidate studying <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing" class="text-secondary">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" class="text-secondary">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, under the advisory of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~andrea/" class="text-secondary">Dr. Andrea Grimes Parker</a>.

    <b>I am currently on the academic job market this cycle, looking for a tenure-track assistant professor position beginning fall 2023. </b>
</p>

<p>
    My research broadly lies in <b>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</b>, <b>Data Visualization (VIS)</b>, <b>Equity</b>, and cross-disciplines of <b>crisis informatics</b> and <b>health informatics</b>.  
    My work has been well recognized by academia: I was named a <a class="text-info" href="https://risingstars.utexas.edu/profiles/yixuan-janice-zhang">Rising Star in EECS</a> 2022, and selected as a <a class="text-info" href="https://gvu.gatech.edu/gvu-graduate-student-awards-program-2022">Foley Scholar</a> (the highest award for student excellence in research contributions to computing at Georgia Tech).
    <b> The impact of my research extends beyond academia</b>: I was invited to present my work focused on crisis visualization design and public trust to broader audiences such as the World Health Organization (WHO).
</p>

<p>
    My PhD dissertation has focused on examining how people form their online trust in a way that promotes the usage of information and technologies, and how we can design trustworthy information and technologies that enhance wellbeing, with a focus on vulnerable and marginalized populations. 
    To answer these questions, I have used a variety of empirical methods, such as (longitudinal) surveys, interviews, observations, co-design, systematic analysis of artifacts, and user evaluations.

    In my spare time, I am a photographer <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>. I also have a sweet puppy---a Border Collie Dog breed (and his name is "Sunny") <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>. Some of my hobbies teach me how to see the world and research from other lens through my camera and my puppy's perspective, with love and peace.

<!-- My research interest lies at the intersection of crisis informatics, visualization, and health sciences. My research seeks to enhance the autonomy of marginalized populations during crises through information technology. My PhD dissertation has focused on examining how the design of information and technologies shapes trust and distrust among marginalized communities, and how mistrust undermines their autonomy during crises. To explore how technological systems can be designed to reduce inequity, I capture people’s interactions with technologies and the dynamics of people’s perceptions during emerging crises through surveys, interviews, observations, co-design, systematic analysis of artifacts, and user evaluations. My research shapes the understanding of how marginalized groups interact and perceive the massive amount of information and how trust forms, develops and collapses among these groups. My research sheds light on how technologies can mitigate informational vulnerability and help marginalized groups navigate through crises. -->

<!-- examines how the crisis information infrastructures (i.e., networks of sociotechnical systems that facilitate information and communication during crises) shape, and simultaneously, are shaped by people's interactions with, perceptions of, and trust towards information, technologies, and information infrastructures. 
    I further examine how trust forms, shifts, and collapses as crisis information infrastructures evolve.  -->
